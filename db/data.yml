    - The Dharma Bums
    - Jack Kerouac
    - 1958
    - 'Two ebullient young men search for Truth the Zen way: from marathon wine-drinking
      bouts, poetry jam sessions, and "yabyum" in San Francisco''s Bohemia to solitude
      in the high Sierras and a vigil atop Desolation Peak in Washington State. Published
      just a year after On the Road put the Beat Generation on the map, The Dharma
      Bums is sparked by Kerouac''s expansiveness, humor, and a contagious zest for
      life.'

    - Miss Lonelyhearts
    - Nathanael West
    - 1933
    - 'As described by Atkinson in the NY Times: "A scornful feature editor of a newspaper
      picks an ambitious young reporter to conduct the advice of the lovelorn column.
      Ambitious, opportunistic, ''Miss Lonelyhearts,'' as the conductor of the column
      is inevitably dubbed, begins with contempt of the correspondents and confidence
      in his own cleverness. As time goes on, the genuineness of the agony in the
      letters that come in gets under the skin of the columnist. He is distressed
      to find himself presiding over a monstrous swindle. For he is an idealist in
      collision with humanity, as his diabolical managing editor expresses it."'

    - Faceless Killers
    - Henning Mankell
    - 1991
    - "It was a senselessly violent crime: on a cold night in a remote Swedish farmhouse
      an elderly farmer is bludgeoned to death, and his wife is left to die with a
      noose around her neck. And as if this didn’t present enough problems for the
      Ystad police Inspector Kurt Wallander, the dying woman’s last word is foreign,
      leaving the police the one tangible clue they have–and in the process, the match
      that could inflame Sweden’s already smoldering anti-immigrant sentiments. \r\n\r\nUnlike
      the situation with his ex-wife, his estranged daughter, or the beautiful but
      married young prosecuter who has piqued his interest, in this case, Wallander
      finds a problem he can handle. He quickly becomes obsessed with solving the
      crime before the already tense situation explodes, but soon comes to realize
      that it will require all his reserves of energy and dedication to solve."

    - Mrs Dalloway
    - Virginia Woolf
    - 1925
    - In Mrs. Dalloway, the novel on which the movie The Hours was based, Virginia
      Woolf details Clarissa Dalloway’s preparations for a party of which she is to
      be hostess, exploring the hidden springs of thought and action in one day of
      a woman’s life. The novel "contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive
      and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be
      reason enough to read it. It is one of the most moving, revolutionary artworks
      of the twentieth century" (Michael Cunningham).

    - The Rum Diary
    - Hunter S. Thompson
    - 1998
    - Begun in 1959 by a twenty-two-year-old Hunter S. Thompson, The Rum Diary is
      a brilliantly tangled love story of jealousy, treachery, and violent alcoholic
      lust in the Caribbean boomtown that was San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the late 1950s.
      The narrator, freelance journalist Paul Kemp, irresistibly drawn to a sexy,
      mysterious woman, is soon thrust into a world where corruption and get-rich-quick
      schemes rule and anything (including murder) is permissible. Exuberant and mad,
      youthful and energetic, this dazzling comedic romp provides a fictional excursion
      as riveting and outrageous as Thompson’s Fear and Loathing books.

    - The Happy Birthday of Death
    - Gregory Corso
    - 1960
    - It is true that he has been one of the inner circle of the 'Beats' from the
      first, but many admirers of his poetry feel that it belongs quite as much to
      other and older traditions in world literature. One of these is the revival
      of pure poetry whenever an “original”––be it Rimbaud or Whitman––has broken
      with current verse conventions to give free rein to the magic of language. Another
      is that ancient pre-occupation of poets––the sense of the immediacy of death.
      Like Villon or Dylan Thomas, Corso lives close to the mystery of death. It is,
      perhaps, his central theme, on which variations ranging from the terrible to
      the comic are sounded. But Corso is seldom macabre. A bursting vitality always
      carries him back to the sensations of the living, though always it is the reality
      behind the obvious which has caught his eye. “How I love to probe life,” Corso
      has written, “That’s what poetry is to me, a wondrous prober… It’s not the metre
      or measure of a line, a breath; not ‘law’ music; but the assembly of great eye
      sounds placed into an inspired measured idea.”

    - The Waste Land
    - T. S. Eliot
    - 1922
    - The Waste Land is a long poem by T. S. Eliot, widely regarded as one of the
      most important poems of the 20th century and a central work of modernist poetry.[2][3]
      Published in 1922, the 434-line[B] poem first appeared in the United Kingdom
      in the October issue of The Criterion and in the United States in the November
      issue of The Dial. It was published in book form in December 1922. Among its
      famous phrases are "April is the cruellest month", "I will show you fear in
      a handful of dust", and the mantra in the Sanskrit language "Shantih shantih
      shantih."

    - Jennifer Egan
    - 2010
    - Jennifer Egan’s spellbinding interlocking narratives circle the lives of Bennie
      Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate,
      troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each
      other’s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives
      of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years,
      in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa.

    - Revolutionary Road
    - Richard Yates
    - 1961
    - 'In the hopeful 1950s, Frank and April Wheeler appear to be a model couple:
      bright, beautiful, talented, with two young children and a starter home in the
      suburbs. Perhaps they married too young and started a family too early. Maybe
      Frank''s job is dull. And April never saw herself as a housewife. Yet they have
      always lived on the assumption that greatness is only just around the corner.
      But now that certainty is about to crumble. With heartbreaking compassion and
      remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their
      spiritual birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves.'
